Just for those who are initiating in Symfony 6, here is a simple CRUD application. 
It has:
  ArticleController with methods for create, read, update and delete.
  Article Entity with getters and setters. 
  Twig-based template system, with some Bootstrap styles.
  A simple main.js javascript script for fetching the server on delete method.
  Some .htaccess configuration.

php version: 8.0.3 

Hope it could be useful...
